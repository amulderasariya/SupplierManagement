# Supplier Management Application

## Introduction:

Customer relationship management is known as CRM. Any size company or organization, no matter how big or little, uses this technology to support and maintain client relationships. It is used by B2B businesses in a variety of industries, including high tech, manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and more.

The platform we are building will be targeting a niche market of independent business owners who want to manage their supplier clientele. This portal will get all the independent business associated clients (i.e supplier) and manage invoicing, product listing and help with tracking & settling invoices.
